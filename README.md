Until then, I'm stuck inside of this nasty man
I'll always wonder what happened to me, lost inside
I told my story, you'll never know
And if there's a *** in the country now, she probably too can relate
She probably won't forgive us, but she'll probably give us a ring
The best memories come first, of course
I tell that story to the world, even if it's at the eleventh hour
I moved up from place to place, trying to find my voice
Now I keep getting older, and that just doesn't feel right
I'm having trouble sleeping, trying to think of some better times
